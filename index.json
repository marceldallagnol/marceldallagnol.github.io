These constructions achieve succinctness by combining probabilistic proofs and vector commitments.\n\nOur first result concerns the succinct interactive argument of Kilian, realized with any probabilistically-checkable proof (PCP) and any vector commitment. We establish the tightest known bounds on the security of this protocol. Prior analyses incur large overheads unsuitable for concrete security, or assume special (and restrictive) properties of the underlying PCP.\n\nOur second result concerns an interactive variant of the BCS succinct non-interactive argument, which here we call IBCS, realized with any public-coin interactive oracle proof (IOP) and any vector commitment. We establish tight bounds on the security of this protocol. While this variant has been informally discussed in the literature, no prior security analysis, even asymptotic, existed before this work.\n\nFinally, we study the capabilities and limitations of succinct arguments based on vector commitments. We show that a generalization of the IBCS protocol, which we call the Finale protocol, is secure when realized with any public-query IOP (a notion that we introduce) that satisfies a natural \"random continuation sampling\" (RCS) property. We also show a partial converse: if the Finale protocol satisfies the RCS property (which in particular implies its security), then so does the underlying public-query IOP.","tags":[],"title":"On the Security of Succinct Interactive Arguments from Vector Commitments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Graham Cormode","Tom Gur","Chris Hickey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662249600,"objectID":"457cd93ccb590f0bdfdf82b5d2123c5e","permalink":"http://marceldallagnol.github.io/publication/streaming-zk/","publishdate":"2022-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/streaming-zk/","section":"publication","summary":"We initiate the study of zero-knowledge proofs for data streams. Streaming interactive proofs (SIPs) are well-studied protocols whereby a space-bounded algorithm with one-pass access to a massive stream of data communicates with a powerful but untrusted prover to verify a computation that requires large space.\n\n We define the notion of *zero-knowledge* in the streaming setting and construct zero-knowledge SIPs for the two main building blocks in the streaming interactive proofs literature: the *sumcheck* and *polynomial evaluation* protocols. To the best of our knowledge *all* known streaming interactive proofs are based on either of these tools, and indeed, this allows us to obtain zero-knowledge SIPs for many central streaming problems, such as index, frequency moments, and inner product. Our protocols are efficient in terms of time and space, as well as communication: the space complexity is $\\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ and, after a non-interactive setup that uses a random string of near-linear length, the remaining parameters are $n^{o(1)}$.\n\n En route, we develop a toolkit for designing zero knowledge data stream protocols that may be of independent interest, consisting of a *homomorphic streaming commitment protocol* and a *temporal commitment protocol*. The analysis of our protocols relies on delicate information-theoretic arguments and reductions from average-case communication complexity.","tags":[],"title":"Streaming Zero-Knowledge Proofs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656684000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656684000,"objectID":"523ad8ac0e5b0205410d19828b26c26f","permalink":"http://marceldallagnol.github.io/talk/daisies-halg/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/daisies-halg/","section":"talk","summary":"Error-correcting codes are procedures that map messages (strings) to codewords (larger strings) in a way that makes the message recoverable even when the codeword is significantly corrupted.

Combinatorial sunflowers are set systems where the pairwise intersection between any two sets coincides with the intersection among all of them. They have become objects of intense study, largely driven by the famous \"sunflower conjecture\" of Erdös and Rado.\n\nThis presentation will discuss two mathematical objects - daisies (a relaxation of combinatorial sunflowers) and relaxed locally decodable codes - and the relationship between them.

These notions have been very successful in facilitating the \"lifting\" of classical security proofs to the quantum setting. A basic and natural question remains unanswered, however: are they the _weakest_ notions that suffice for such lifting?\n\nIn this work we answer this question in the affirmative by giving a classical commit-and-open protocol which is post-quantum secure if and only if the commitment scheme (resp. hash function) used is collapse binding (resp. collapsing). We also generalise the definition of collapse binding to \u001bmph{quantum commitment schemes}, and prove that the equivalence carries over even when the sender in the commit-and-open protocol above communicates quantum information.\n\nThis establishes that a variety of \"weak\" binding notions (sum binding, CDMS binding and unequivocality) are in fact _equivalent_ to collapse binding, both for post-quantum and quantum commitments.\n\nFinally, we establish a \"win-win\" result, showing that a post-quantum computationally binding commitment scheme that is not collapse binding can be used to build an equivocal commitment scheme (which can, in turn, be used to build one-shot signatures and other useful quantum primitives). This strengthens a result due to Zhandry (Eurocrypt '19) showing that the same object yields quantum lightning.","tags":[],"title":"On the Necessity of Collapsing for Post-Quantum and Quantum Commitments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625505900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625505900,"objectID":"3240884a7717e9d634e8add5037ff91d","permalink":"http://marceldallagnol.github.io/talk/qmap-tqc/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/qmap-tqc/","section":"talk","summary":"We initiate the systematic study of QMA algorithms in the setting of property testing, to which we refer as *QMA proofs of proximity* (QMAPs).
