Logo de cara, descobrimos que cripto perfeita não existe. Tentando achar uma saída, encontramos problemas que o Universo trabalhando desde o big bang não daria conta de resolver. Além disso, veremos que ninguém sabe se a cripto que usamos todos os dias é segura de verdade (por sorte, ninguém mostrou que não é). Por fim, exploramos o que a computação quântica muda nisso tudo. \n\nNesta palestra, que ninguém precisa ser matemáticx para assistir, exploramos a história da criptografia desde muito antes dos computadores até o futuro da computação quântica.\n\nO que é necessário para construir cripto? Se é tão antiga, por que essa ciência hoje tem tanto a ver com computação? Podemos nos sentir seguros com nossos laptops e celulares contra o aparato da NSA? (se sim, até quando?)\n\nPrimeiro, estabelecemos os componentes básicos para um algoritmo criptográfico (seja no computador ou com papel e caneta). Em seguida, vemos alguns exemplos: a cifra de César e as de substituição.\n\nComo cripto depende de operações \"difíceis de desfazer\", buscamos uma definição de dificuldade que se possa medir. Descobrimos, aí, o motivo para os computadores serem tão importantes, exploramos o algoritmo One-Time Pad e o conceito de complexidade algorítmica.\n\nEntão vemos como funcionam dois dos algoritmos mais importantes e usados hoje em dia: Diffie-Hellman e RSA. Por fim, vemos com cuidado o que a computação quântica traz de novo: como ela pode ser usada para fortalecer nossa segurança, quais algoritmos ela quebra (e quais não), e se ela é tudo isso que dizem por aí.","tags":[],"title":"The mathematical beauty of cryptography (in Portuguese)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Emily Grenader","Troels E.

The design and creation of these stage effects are rarely accessible to actual performers and must be designed by professional lighting designers or highly-paid programmers. With MotionDraw we want to create an affordable system that is easily controlled and manipulated by performers. With intuitive gestures, non-specialized users can control the MotionDraw visual library and interact with the captured visual record of their own movements. Possible uses of our system grew out of research with dancers and performers, and the current technical implementation sets a framework for including additional visual libraries and capabilities.","tags":[],"title":"MotionDraw: a Tool for Enhancing Art and Performance Using Kinect","type":"publication"}]
