Streaming interactive proofs (SIPs) are well-studied protocols whereby a space-bounded algorithm with one-pass sequential access to a massive stream of data communicates with an all-powerful but untrusted prover to verify a computation that requires large space.\n\n We define the notion of *zero-knowledge* in the streaming setting and construct zero-knowledge SIPs for the two main building blocks in the streaming interactive proofs literature: the *sumcheck* and *polynomial evaluation* protocols. To the best of our knowledge *all* known streaming interactive proofs are based on either of these tools, and indeed, this allows us to obtain zero-knowledge SIPs for many central streaming problems, such as index, frequency moments, range queries, median and inner product.\n\n En route, we develop a toolkit for designing zero knowledge data stream protocols that may be of independent interest, consisting of a *homomorphic streaming commitment scheme* and a *temporal commitment protocol*. The analysis of our protocols relies on delicate information-theoretic arguments and reductions from average-case communication complexity.","tags":[],"title":"Streaming Zero-Knowledge Proofs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656684000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656684000,"objectID":"523ad8ac0e5b0205410d19828b26c26f","permalink":"http://marceldallagnol.github.io/talk/daisies-halg/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/daisies-halg/","section":"talk","summary":"Error-correcting codes are procedures that map messages (strings) to codewords (larger strings) in a way that makes the message recoverable even when the codeword is significantly corrupted. Codes that are locally decodable have additional structure: in order to recover a single character of the message, one need only read a small number of characters of the codeword. Combinatorial sunflowers are set systems where the pairwise intersection between any two sets coincides with the intersection among all of them. They have become objects of intense study, largely driven by the famous \"sunflower conjecture\" of Erd√∂s and Rado.\n\nThis presentation will discuss two mathematical objects - daisies (a relaxation of combinatorial sunflowers) and relaxed locally decodable codes - and the relationship between them. We highlight recent lower bounds for the size of such codes, obtained via a translation of algorithms for local codes into the language of set systems.","tags":[],"title":"A Structural Theorem for Local Algorithms with Applications to Coding, Testing, and Privacy","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nicholas Spooner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630713600,"objectID":"afddb4fdc5246eb3e950f57d880d0594","permalink":"http://marceldallagnol.github.io/publication/chosen-bit-binding/","publishdate":"2021-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chosen-bit-binding/","section":"publication","summary":"Collapse binding and collapsing were proposed by Unruh (Eurocrypt '16) as post-quantum strengthenings of computational binding and collision resistance, respectively. These notions have been very successful in facilitating the \"lifting\" of classical security proofs to the quantum setting. A basic and natural question remains unanswered, however: are they the _weakest_ notions that suffice for such lifting?\n\nIn this work we answer this question in the affirmative by giving a classical commit-and-open protocol which is post-quantum secure if and only if the commitment scheme (resp. hash function) used is collapse binding (resp. collapsing).\n\nWe also generalise the definition of collapse-binding to \u001bmph{quantum commitment schemes}, and prove that the equivalence carries over even when the sender in the commit-and-open protocol above communicates quantum information.\n\nThis establishes that a variety of \"weak\" binding notions (sum binding, CDMS binding and unequivocality) are in fact _equivalent_ to collapse binding, both for post-quantum and quantum commitments.\n\nFinally, we establish a \"win-win\" result, showing that a post-quantum computationally binding commitment scheme that is not collapse-binding can be used to build an equivocal commitment scheme (which can, in turn, be used to build one-shot signatures and other useful quantum primitives). This strengthens a result due to Zhandry (Eurocrypt '19) showing that the same object yields quantum lightning. For this result we make use of recent quantum rewinding techniques.","tags":[],"title":"On the Necessity of Collapsing for Post-Quantum and Quantum Commitments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625505900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625505900,"objectID":"3240884a7717e9d634e8add5037ff91d","permalink":"http://marceldallagnol.github.io/talk/qmap-tqc/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/qmap-tqc/","section":"talk","summary":"We initiate the systematic study of QMA algorithms in the setting of property testing, to which we refer as *QMA proofs of proximity* (QMAPs).
